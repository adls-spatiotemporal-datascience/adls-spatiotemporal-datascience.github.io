2. Submit the URL to this organisation to us via mail
2. In this Organisation, create a new, blank repository called `week-1`.

On your local machine:

1. Install CLI Software [quarto](https://quarto.org/)
2. Create a new directory to solve this weeks task.
3. Make this folder a `git` repository (`git init`) and use the GitHub Repo you created previously as a remote (`git remote add origin <URL>`)
4. Create a new file called `_quarto.yml` with the content as shown below
5. Create a new quarto file called `index.qmd` with the content as shown below
6. Run the CLI command `quarto preview` to preview the document
7. Run the CLI command `quarto publish gh-pages` to publish the document to GitHub Pages

```{.markdown filename="index.qmd"}
# Solution for Week1: Vector data processing
   
In this document, I solve the tasks for week 1 of the course 
*Spatiotemporal Datascience*
```



## Task 2 {#sec-gh-pages}

1. Download the datasets [swissTLM3D](https://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/en/landscape-model-swisstlm3d) and [swissboundaries3d](https://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/en/landscape-model-swissboundaries3d) from swisstopo.
2. Add the datasets to the local folder you created above, in a subfolder named `data`
3. Add the data folder to the `.gitignore` file.

5. Using `swissTLM3d` and `swissboundaries3d`, calculate the percentage of area covered by forest *per canton*
6. Visualize the results (in a map and / or a plot)
