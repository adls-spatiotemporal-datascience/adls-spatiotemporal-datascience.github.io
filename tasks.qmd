# Syllabus

## Prerequisites

- Completion of the course *GISc and Geodatabases* or equivalent experience with:
  - R programming (tidyverse, basic data wrangling)
  - Vector data handling with `sf`
  - Raster data handling with `terra`
- Basic familiarity with Git and GitHub
- Familiarity with the command line

## Assessment

This module is graded with a so called *Erfahrungsnote*, based on your solutions to the tasks provided throughout the course.

### What to Submit

<!-- TODO: Which tasks are mandatory? Options:
     - All tasks mandatory
     - A fixed selection of core tasks (e.g., one per topic)
     - "Submit X of Y" with free choice
     - Mandatory core tasks + elective tasks
-->

You must submit solutions for the following tasks:

| Task   | Topic                  | Due Date   |
|--------|------------------------|------------|
| 4.1    | Topological Relations  | Week 3     |
| 5.1    | Raster / GDAL          | Week 5     |
| 7.1    | Interpolation          | Week 8     |
| ...    | ...                    | ...        |

### Grading Criteria

Each task is evaluated on three dimensions:

| Criterion              | Weight | Description |
|------------------------|--------|-------------|
| **Correctness**        | 40%    | Code runs without errors and produces the expected output |
| **Documentation**      | 30%    | Clear explanations of your approach, code is readable and commented where necessary |
| **Reflection**         | 30%    | Discussion of limitations, alternatives considered, or lessons learned |

A working solution alone is not sufficient for a top grade. We expect you to demonstrate understanding, not just output.

### Use of AI Tools

You may use AI assistants (ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, Claude, etc.) to support your work. However:

- Your submission must reflect *your* understanding
- The documentation and reflection sections are where you demonstrate this
- Copy-pasting AI output without comprehension will be evident and graded accordingly

We treat AI tools like any other resource: useful, but not a substitute for learning.

<!-- TODO: Do you want to include an oral component (spot-check / defense)?
     This would help verify understanding but scales poorly with class size.
-->

## Deadlines

<!-- TODO: Deadline policy - choose one:
     - Fixed per task (due before next task session)
     - Rolling deadlines (e.g., 2 weeks after topic)
     - Single end-of-semester deadline for all tasks
-->

Task solutions are due **before the next task session** (typically two weeks after the topic is introduced). Late submissions will be accepted but may receive reduced feedback.

<!-- TODO: Feedback policy:
     - Do you provide feedback on each submission?
     - Only a final grade at the end?
     - Feedback only on request?
-->

## Submission via GitHub Pages {#sec-gh-pages}

Each task is submitted as a rendered Quarto document hosted on GitHub Pages.

### Initial Setup (Week 1)

On GitHub:

1. [Create a free organisation](https://github.com/organizations/plan) named `ADLS-STDS2025-kuerzel` (replace `kuerzel` with your ZHAW email prefix)
2. Submit the URL to this organisation via email
3. In this organisation, create a new, blank repository called `ADLS-STDS2025-kuerzel.github.io`

On your local machine:

1. Install the CLI tool [Quarto](https://quarto.org/)
2. Create a new directory for this week's task
3. Initialize a Git repository and link it to your GitHub repo:
   ```bash
   git init
   git remote add origin <URL>
   ```
4. Create `_quarto.yml`:
   ```{.yaml filename="_quarto.yml"}
   project:
     output-dir: _docs
   ```
5. Create `index.qmd`:
   ```{.markdown filename="index.qmd"}
   # Solutions for the course *Spatiotemporal DataScience*

   Here are my solutions to the tasks in *Spatiotemporal Datascience*.
   ```
6. Preview locally: `quarto preview`
7. Publish: `quarto publish gh-pages`

### Subsequent Weeks

For each new task week, create a new repository in your organisation (e.g., `week-4`, `week-5`) and follow the same workflow.
