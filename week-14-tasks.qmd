As always, the data for this task is on moodle. Follow the instructions in @sec-gh-pages from Week 1 to create a new repo in the existing organization.


Redo you task from [last Week](#sec-min-ex), but further extend your features by using the approach described in @sec-adding-context. Add at least 2, to 3 features of your own.

Compare your results to the ones you got last week. Does your model perform better if context information is added?
