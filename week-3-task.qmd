Today, we will recap the basics of working with spatial data in R from [Geocomputation "Raster Data"](https://zhaw-giscience-geodatabases.github.io) (Course GIScience and Geodatabases).



# Tasks

Follow the instructions in @sec-gh-pages from last week to create a new repo in the existing organization. As you did last week, solve the next task in a file named `index.qmd`.


1. Redo the task from last week. However, rather than doing it using vector data, convert the data to raster and do the calculations in raster format.
2. Using the R package [`tictoc`](http://jabiru.github.io/tictoc/), measure the execute time of each step in the process. Do this for the raster approach and for the vector approach from last week. 
3. Compare the execution times of the two approaches. Which approach is faster? Where is the bottleneck? 
4. Compare the results of the two approaches. Are they the same? If not, why?

<!--
1. Download an orthophoto (e.g. `Orthofoto ZH 2014/15 Sommer`) from the GIS Browser of the canton of Zurich [geo.zh.ch/maps](https://geo.zh.ch/maps).
2. Import the dataset into R
3. Check the raster resolution. Resample to a 10m resulution using `aggregate`.
4. plot a false color image using the bands NIR (4), Green (2) and Blue (1)
5. Calculate the NDVI with the following formula

$$\text{NDVI} = \frac{\text{NIR}-\text{Red}}{\text{NIR}+\text{Red}}$$
