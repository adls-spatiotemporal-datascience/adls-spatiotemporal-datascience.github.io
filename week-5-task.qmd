## Task 5.1 {#sec-task-rast-advanced}

Follow the instructions in @sec-gh-pages from Week 1 to create a new repo in the existing organization. As you did in the previous weeks, solve the next task in a file named `index.qmd`.

1. Redo @sec-task-rast-basic. However, this time use `gdal` from the command line to to the processing. Note that you can use `bash` commands in quarto, you just have to 
   - set the language to `{bash}` in the code chunk and 
   - the `engine` to `knitr` in the YAML header
2. Again, use the R package [`tictoc`](http://jabiru.github.io/tictoc/) to measure the execute time of each step in the process. To measure the execution time of bash commands, you can use the approach shown below.
3. Compare the execution times of with the `terra` approach. Which is faster? 


````
```{{r}}
tictoc::tic(msg = "Step 1: Transform the data")
```

```{{bash}}
gdal_translate input.tif output.tif
```

```{{r}}
tictoc::toc(log = TRUE)
```


```{{r}}
# Finally (to get a full log:)
tictoc::tic.log()
```
