    "text": "We briefly touched topological relations in Spatial queries using binary predicate functions\nTopological relations describe the spatial relationships between objects.\nThey are also called binary topological relationships or binary predicates\nThey are logical statements (TRUE/FALSE) about the spatial relationships between two objects\nThe two objects are defined by ordered sets of points (typically forming points, lines and polygons) in two or more dimensions (Egenhofer and Herring 1990).\n\n\nUsage\n\nTopological relations can be used to subset or join spatial data\nFor example:\n\nSubsetting: Return all rivers that flow through the canton of Zurich\nJoining: For every train station, give me the name of the municipality it lies within\n\n\n\n\nNamed topological relations (I)\n\nThe most common topological relations are offered as functions / tools in most GIS software\nIn sf, the following topological functions are available:\n\nst_intersects()\nst_disjoint()\nst_touches()\nst_crosses()\nst_within()\nst_contains()\nst_contains_properly()\nst_overlaps()\nst_equals()\nst_covers()\nst_covered_by()\nst_equals_exact()\nst_is_within_distance()\n\nThese all work slightly differently, and are used in different contexts.\nFor example:\n\nst_covers() returns TRUE if no points of x are outside y, and at least one point of x is inside y.\nst_touches() returns TRUE if the geometries have at least one point in common, but their interiors do not intersect.\n\n\n\n\nNamed topological relations (II)\n\nSome of the relations mentioned above are symmetrical (the order of the geometries does not matter)\nFor example, if st_touches(x, y) is TRUE, then st_touches(y, x) is also TRUE\nOthers are not, meaning that the order of the geometries is important.\nFor example, st_contains(x, y) returns TRUE if x contains y, but st_contains(y, x) returns FALSE\nSome of the relations require additional arguments, such as st_is_within_distance(), which requires a distance argument\nYou can find the full list of topological relations in the sf documentation using ?geos_binary_pred\n\n\n\nSubset Examples\n\nLet’s take the example of the playgrounds in Zurich and the public transport stops.\nWe can subset the playground data to only include playgrounds that are close (e.g. 100m) to public transport stops\n\n\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(readr)\n# source: https://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/geodaten/\nplaygrounds &lt;- read_sf(\"data/week4-exercises/playgrounds.gpkg\")\npublictransport &lt;- read_sf(\"data/week4-exercises/public_transport.gpkg\")\n\n# Using the shorthand notation\nplaygrounds_close &lt;- playgrounds[publictransport,,op = st_is_within_distance, dist = 100]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.1: Note that the playgrounds within 100m of public transport (red dots) are a subset of all the playgrounds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpatial join Example (I)\n\nIn a spatial join, we want to add information from one dataset to another based on their spatial relationship\nFor example, we can add the name of the nearest public transport stop to each playground.\nFor this, we will use the function st_nearest_feature\nStrictly speaking, this function is not binary predicate, but is very useful for spatial joins\nTo make the example clearer, I will first discard all unnecessary columns from the datasets\n\n\npublictransport &lt;- publictransport[,\"CHSTNAME\"]\n\nplaygrounds &lt;- playgrounds[, \"name\"]\n\n\nplaygrounds_join &lt;- st_join(\n  playgrounds, \n  publictransport, \n  join = st_nearest_feature\n  )\n\n\nplaygrounds_join\n\nSimple feature collection with 184 features and 2 fields\nGeometry type: POINT\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 2677632 ymin: 1242927 xmax: 2687639 ymax: 1253914\nProjected CRS: CH1903+ / LV95\n# A tibble: 184 × 3\n   name                                                    geom CHSTNAME        \n * &lt;chr&gt;

    "text": "Custom topological relations\n\nIn case the named topological relations (see Named topological relations (I)) do not covery a specific usecase, we can gain more fine grained control using so called DE-9IM strings.\nDE-9IM stands for Dimensionally Extended nine-Intersection Model and is the formal definition of the topological relations between two geometries\nDE-9IM powers all binary predicate functions like st_intersects etc.\nThe concept is a bit complex, but the idea is that it describes the topological relationship between two geometries in a 3x3 matrix.\nThe reasons the matrix is 3x3 is because it considers the intersection of the (1) interior, (2) boundary, and (3) exterior of the geometries.\nTable 10.1 shows how two overlapping polygons are analyzed using DE-9IM\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 10.1: Image source: M.

This is denoted as 2\nthe intersection of interior with boundary results in a line, this is denoted as 1\nthe intersection of boundary with boundary results in two points, this is denoted as 0\n\nOnce all nine intersections have been regarded and encoded, the result is flattened into a string (with nine characters) which describes the topological relationship precisely\nIn the example in Table 10.1, a compact representation as string code is 212101212\nThis concept is especially interesting from the opposite perspective: i.e. we describe the DE-9IM string we are looking for (see next chapter)\n\n\nRook’s case\n\nAs alluded in the last chapter, the DE-9IM string can help us look for specific relations not covered in the named topological relation\nConsider a chessboard like situation with 3x3 fields (see Figure 10.3)\nFrom the origin field, you might be interested to know all fields that share a full edge (i.e. how a rook would move)\nThis relation is not covered by the named topological relations, so we need to model it using a DE-9IM string\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.3: A 3x3 chessboard with a rook in the center field (origin). Which fields can the rook reach, if the constraint is that the destination field need to share an endge with the origin?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModeling the rook’s case\n\nTo specify our requirement (destination field must share a boundary with the origin) we need to use the 3x3 DE-9IM we discussed in Table 10.1\nThe requirement is, that the interiors should not intersect (F) and the intersection of the boundaries should result in a line (1). All other intersections to not matter (*). This is displayed in Table 10.2\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 10.2: The DE-9IM for the rooks case.
