title: "ðŸš€ Tasks"

As always, the data for this task is on moodle. Follow the instructions in @sec-gh-pages from Week 1 to create a new repo in the existing organization.


Your task is to improve upon the simple model we have built in the chapter @sec-min-ex. You can do this by:


1. **Feature Engineering**: Create additional features that you think might help to distinguish between different transportation modes. For example, you could consider turning angles, stop durations or extending observation windows
2. **Model Selection**: Experiment with different models (e.g., random forests, gradient boosting, neural networks) and hyperparameters to improve the predictive performance.
3. **Per point prediction**: Instead of predicting the transportation mode on a per segment basis, try to predict the transportation mode for each point. This is a more challenging task but can provide more detailed insights into the movement behavior.

Using one or more of these approaches, predict the transportation mode for the *validation* dataset. 

<!-- Next week, we will evaluate the performance of your models and award the best performing team with a standing ovation. -->
