- As mentioned in @sec-gdal-ogr2ogr, GDAL is the basis for most GIS Software
- Rather than using GDAL through R or Python, we can use the GDAL CLI tool instead
- GDAL is a software suite containing several so called [Raster programs](https://gdal.org/en/stable/programs/#raster-programs), each designed for a specific task
- These are especially useful if you need faster data processing, e.g. if you have large raster files or a lot of small ones
- You can install GDAL [using conda](https://gdal.org/en/stable/download.html#conda)



## GDALInfo

- The simplest program in GDAL is probabbly `gdalinfo`
- It lists information about a raster dataset.
- The simplest command to test if a CLI tool is working, is to get the version number using `--version `:



```{bash}
#| echo: true
gdalinfo --version
```



### Get help

- All named arguments to `gdalinfo` are listed with `[-argument]`
- Some arguments need parameters: 
  - For example: `-if` stands for *input format*
  - `if Gtiff` specifies that the input is a `GeoTIFF`
  - This allows you to be explicit about your input format, rather than GDAL guessing it from the file extension
  - These inputs are denoted with `<>` (i.e. `[-if <format>]`)
- Positional arguments do not have square brackets
- A positional argument needs to be in a specific position
- `gdalinfo` only has one position argument: `<dataset_name>`


```{bash}
#| echo: true
gdalinfo --help
```



### Get basic Information




```{bash}
#| echo: true
gdalinfo data/week5-exercises/elev-lux.tif
```


### Get histogram

- To calculate a histogram, we can use the argument `-hist` (see the [help page](https://gdal.org/en/stable/programs/gdalinfo.html))
- Note: I'm piping the output into `head` and then `tail` to truncate the result

```{bash}
#| echo: true
gdalinfo -hist data/week5-exercises/elev-lux.tif | tail -n 8 | head -n 2
```


### Get output as JSON

- To get the output as a JSON, use the argument `-json`
- JSON outputs are much easier to to parse 
- This is especially useful if you want to use the output in a script or program


```{bash}
#| output: false
#| echo: true
# pipe the output to a JSON file
gdalinfo -hist -json data/week5-exercises/elev-lux.tif  > data-out/elev-lux.json

```


### Parse JSON output

- Open the file `elev-lux.json` in a browser to get a good idea of the hierarchy
- Use a tool like `jq` to parse the JSON in the terminal
- `jq` is a powerful tool for parsing JSON in the terminal
- We can "climb" down the JSON structure using the `.` operator and the key names
- To extract from an array, we can use `[]`



```{bash}
#| echo: true
gdalinfo -hist data/week5-exercises/elev-lux.tif -json | \
  jq ".bands[].min"
```





### Plots in bash

- To illustrate, we extract the histogram from the data and visualize it with [bashplotlib](https://github.com/glamp/bashplotlib)

```{bash}
#| output: false
#| echo: true
gdalinfo -hist data/week5-exercises/elev-lux.tif -json | 
  jq ".bands[].histogram.buckets[]" | # <1>
  hist -w 1 -p +                      # <2>

```

1. This `jq` filter extracts the raw values from the array
2. `hist` from [bashplotlib](https://github.com/glamp/bashplotlib) creates a histogram: `-w 1` sets the width to 1 and `-p +` creates a `+` instead of a point

```

### Getting the CRS

- To get the Coordinate Reference System (CRS) of a raster, we can filter for the entry `.coordinateSystem`
- The specific raster does not seem to have a CRS assigned, so the output is `null`
- We need to consult the metadata provided by the data provider to get the CRS
- As noted [here](https://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/de/hoehenmodell-dhm25#DHM25---Download), the CRS is `LV03 LN02`, which is the old swiss coordinate system, aka [`EPSG:21781`](https://epsg.io/21781)

```{bash}
#| echo: true
gdalinfo -json data/week5-exercises/dhm25_grid_raster.asc | jq ".coordinateSystem"
```

- We can confirm this by geetting the extent of the raster,
- For this we can use the argument `-json` and then extract the `cornerCoordinates` key




```{bash}
#| echo: true
gdalinfo -json \
  data/week5-exercises/dhm25_grid_raster.asc | 
  jq ".cornerCoordinates"
```


## Gdalwarp

- The DHM25 raster is in the old Swiss coordinate system `EPSG:21781`
- To transform it to the new Swiss coordinate system `EPSG:2056`, we can use the [`gdalwarp`](https://gdal.org/en/stable/programs/gdalwarp.html) program


- Note that `gdalwarp` has two positional arguments: 
  - `<src_dataset_name>...` and `<dst_dataset_name>`
  - The dots indicate that you can input multiple data sources



```{bash}
#| echo: true
gdalwarp --help
```


## Reproject / Transform Raster

- Since our data has no CRS assigned, we need to specify the source CRS using `-s_srs` 
- The EPSG code for the new Swiss coordinate system is `2056`, which we will provide as the target CRS using `-t_srs`
- We recommend using geotiff rather than ascii output


```{bash}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
gdalwarp -s_srs EPSG:21781 \
  -t_srs EPSG:2056 \ 
  data/week5-exercises/dhm25_grid_raster.asc \
  data-out/dhm25.tif

```



```
0...10...20...30...40...50...60...70...80...90...100 - done.
```

## Check the CRS

- We can now check the CRS on our created dataset

```{bash}
#| echo: true
gdalinfo data-out/dhm25.tif | tail -n 60 | head -n 45
```

<br class ="br">

- As well as the extent
- (note how the values have changed)

```{bash}
#| echo: true
gdalinfo -json data-out/dhm25.tif | 
  jq ".cornerCoordinates"
```
