Follow the instructions in @sec-gh-pages to create a new repo in the existing organization. Solve the next task in a file named `index.qmd`.





## Raster Basics {#sec-task-rast-basic}

1. Redo @sec-vec-basic. However, rather than doing it using vector data, convert the data to raster and do the calculations in raster format.
2. Using the R package [`tictoc`](http://jabiru.github.io/tictoc/), measure the execute time of each step in the process. Do this for the raster approach and for the vector approach from last week. 
3. Compare the execution times of the two approaches. Which approach is faster? Where is the bottleneck? 
4. Compare the results of the two approaches. Are they the same? If not, why?
